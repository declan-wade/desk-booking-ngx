# Desk Booking NGX
A very simple and minimal way to book up to five desks with the following features:

- 🚀 Written in TypeScript using React, Prisma and Next.js
- 🌐 Free database and hosting via Neon
- 🗝️ No auth, a rudimentary PIN system is used for simplicity
- 📱 Fully reactive UI and mobile-ready

## Demo:

[Access Here](https://desk-booking-ngx.vercel.app)
PIN is 123455

## Local Development

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
